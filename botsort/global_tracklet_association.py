    #   structurally cannot handle - two brand-new, temporally-disjoint
    #   tracklets of a person who has no gallery entry yet (nothing to
    #   anchor a Hungarian match against) would otherwise each mint their
    #   own identity independently, one tick apart or even the same tick.
    #   GAEC (borrowed from the previous version of this file) is the right
    #   tool here: general correlation clustering over a small, per-tick-only
    #   pool - not a persistent graph re-clustered forever (that was the old
    #   design's actual bug, not GAEC itself).
    #
    #   Stage 2 (_solve_pending, Hungarian): assigns each resulting CLUSTER
    #   (one merged evidence bundle, one or more member tracklets) to either
    #   an EXISTING gallery identity or a dummy "new identity" column.
    #   Column exclusivity is what prevents two lookalike clusters both
    #   winning the same identity. Unlike stage 1, no temporal-overlap veto
    #   is needed here: two different clusters are, by construction,
    #   different people, so at most one can legitimately win any given
    #   gallery column anyway - the assignment problem already guarantees
    #   that. The only hard veto still required is a cluster's span
    #   conflicting with an identity's CURRENTLY-CLAIMED live occupancy
    #   (the gallery column has no "busy until" state of its own) - reusing
    #   the exact _gid_seen_at/active_tid co-occurrence check GlobalRegistry
    #   already gets right.
